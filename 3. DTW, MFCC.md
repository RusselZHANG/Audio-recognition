DTW, MFCC
====================================
# 1. DTW: Dynamic Time Warping
---------------------------
DTW is designed for measure the simularities between two audios. \
Indicating whether two audio segment represent the same information. \
## Why DTM? 
* Two audio sequence containing same information may be in different time duration.
* Language speed may be different.
* Even in same words, different chars time occupation is different.
## Method：Time domain comparison
* Compressing/Stretching the signal
* Compute cost-matrix

# 2. MFCC(Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient) Voice Feature:
---------------------------
The extracted formant (peak of spectrum) is the principle component who contains the unique information of voice identity. \
## Why MFCC: best voice feature for recognition and speaker separation
The human hearing concentrating on a series of specific frequency rather than the whole spectrum: a non-linear system response( distributed dense at low frequency and sparse in higher frequency). \
In mel domain, the perception is linear.
## How to compute:
* log(|X(f)|) = log(|H(f)|) + log(|E(f)|) =log(|FFT(x(t))|)
* h[k]+e[k] = Inverse FFT(log(|X(f)|)) (h(k) is the spectrum envelop, e(k) is spectrum details fluctuation(noise)
* h[k] = low pass filter (h[k]+e[k])
* Mel(f) = 2595lg(1+f/700)


![Speech Recognition System](https://github.com/RusselZHANG/Audio-recognition/blob/master/images/system.JPG)
Conventionnal component of system:
* Acoustic model
* Pronounciation model(feature extraction from wav)
* Language model
# 3. Visualization：
-------------------------
* 1D amplitude signal(frequency/time)
* 2D spectrogram

# 4. Wav2char：
-------------------------
Find the corresponding character from sound slice, the result from current character prediction will influence the next value. \
Opertation: interrupt token, repeating token, post-processing

# 5. Code
* Define SR(7 models, wav2char)
* Necessary to use with...as to play speech_recognition.AudioData format
* gTTS(char2wav tool), gtts.save() need to use non pre-existing path
* Sphinx accuracy is not so good
* Chatrobot: Q&A system with listened words to trigger speak module
