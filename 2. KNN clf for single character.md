KNN classification with little signal
===================
## Code
* Librosa for audio signal processing
  * `waveplot` with audio-time signal and sampling rate
  * `MFCC` feature with spectrogram
* Access to all files: ` files = [f for f in os.listdir(dirname) if not f.startswith('.')]`
* Visualization: 
  *`plt.pcolormesh` and data organization
  * To draw the border,it must mesh all the grid and predicted every grid through clf
* KNN prediction method
  * Non-linear clf
  * In this problem features are organized as distances between all of the test cases
  * features are calculated with MFCC
